# CRUD Spring Boot

This project is a simple *CRUD* application built with *Spring Boot*, demonstrating basic operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The database is simulated using the H2 in-memory engine, meaning data is lost when the project stops. Upon startup, the application automatically creates a table representing the stock of a generic store, allowing you to add products and manage their prices and stock levels.
